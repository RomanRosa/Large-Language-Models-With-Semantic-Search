## Skills and Techniques Acquired

### Enhancing Keyword Search

- 🚀 **Enhanced Keyword Search with Cohere Rerank**: Successfully enhanced keyword search capabilities using Cohere Rerank.

### Leveraging Dense Retrieval with Embeddings

- 🧠 **Used Embeddings for Dense Retrieval**: Applied embeddings to leverage dense retrieval, an effective tool in natural language processing (NLP).

### Evaluation and Optimization

- 🔍 **Evaluated Effectiveness for Optimization**: Assessed the effectiveness of implemented techniques, setting the stage for further optimization.

## Key Learnings from the Course on Enhancing Search with LLMs

### Overview of Keyword Search and LLM Integration

In this course, I gained an in-depth understanding of how traditional keyword search methods, while common, can be limiting for content-rich websites. I learned how incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) into search systems can significantly enhance user experience, allowing more intuitive querying and information retrieval.

### Core Techniques and Concepts

- 🌐 **Explored Dense Retrieval**: I explored key concepts like dense retrieval, which improves the relevance of retrieved information, thus enhancing search results beyond traditional keyword methods.

- ⚙️ **Reranking with LLMs**: I delved into reranking, a technique that integrates the intelligence of LLMs into search systems, making them faster and more effective.

### Course Achievements

- 🗝️ **Implemented Basic Keyword Search**: Understood and implemented basic keyword search, the foundation of many search systems before the advent of accessible language models.

- 🔄 **Enhanced Keyword Search with Rerank Method**: Enhanced keyword search capabilities using the rerank method, which ranks responses by relevance to the query.

- 🔍 **Implemented Dense Retrieval with Embeddings**: Employed embeddings for dense retrieval, a powerful NLP tool that uses the semantic meaning of text for search, vastly improving results.

- 💪 **Gained Hands-On Practice with Large Data Sets**: Worked with large amounts of data, overcoming challenges related to varying search results and accuracy.

- 🤖 **Integrated Language Model-Powered Search**: Successfully implemented language model-powered search into a website or project.

This course equipped me with the knowledge and skills needed to leverage LLMs in search applications, transforming the way search functions in modern, content-rich environments.
